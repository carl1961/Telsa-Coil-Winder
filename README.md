# TelsaCoilWinder

This repository contains the code and documentation needed to construct your own Telsa Coil Winder.    


## Organization

The repository is organized in the following fashion:
- 3DPrinterFiles:  3D printed files.
- AccelStepper_SketchV4:  Souce code for the Arduino Uno.  I tried to comment the code to make it more understandable.  
- Documentation:  Document describing the Tesla Coil Winder.  Explaination and parts list.
- EasyEDA: Source for custom PCB.
- JLCPCB:  Gerber file for PCB.
- Source files for the Nextion.

## Special thanks to:

Masculinity -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HymLeTU4M8Q - This projects provided most of my inspiration for my build.

carl1961 - https://github.com/carl1961/Arduino-Nano-Tesla-Coil-Winder   Who has beening using some of the code from my project.

## Note:

This project is a work in progress, and well continue to change as I know more.  Picture shows AWG 26, 28, 32, and 34 wire testing.
